Set up and create state variables in the constructor of a React class component. The state variables let the component handle and keep track of dynamic data like "likes" and "dislikes"

Make arrow functions in the state of a component, which contains the code for changing certain state variables when the user does something like click a button.

Using event handling, connect these arrow functions to the onClick events on related UI elements in React.The functions let the state change dynamically based on user interaction.

Add dynamic state data to the rendered UI using the JSX markup.
